            <p>Thank you so much for visiting Baking on a Budget! I'm currently a college student, and I've learned first hand how hard it can be to have time and money available to make delicious meals, which is why I made this site for anyone else out there like me!</p> 
            <p>A little bit about me, like I mentioned before, I'm in college with a major in Accounting and a minor in Data Science. I've been with my boyfriend for over a year now, and have enjoyed every minute of it. I'm from a small town in Texas. I love to read, take naps, and hang out with my friends. I also have a dog who I love very much as well.</p>
            <p>Thanks for getting to know me!</p>
            <h4>Happy Cooking!</h4>
